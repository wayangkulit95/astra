### How to Use the Script

1. **Create the Script:**
   Save the script to a file called `install_astra.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_astra.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install_astra.sh
   ```

4. **Access Cesbo Astra:**
   After the script finishes, it will display the IP address and port for accessing Astra:
   ```
   http://<your_server_ip>:8000
   ```
   You can log in with the default credentials (`admin/admin`).

5. **Change Admin Password:**
   After logging in for the first time, immediately change the default password for security reasons.

### Firewall Configuration (Optional):
If UFW is installed and active, the script will automatically open port `8000` for Astra. If you're using a different firewall, you'll need to manually open the required ports.
